Hi, I put together a few Unity C# scripts for students (or anyone) to use.
I have done my best to keep it simple.
Unity is easy enough for primary school childeren
to get the hang of if there is an adult sitting next to them
showing them what to do.
If a child loves creating games they will learn about sine waves, forces, vectors
rotations and a whole lot more without anyone having to make them do it.
The only danger is that they will enjoy it so much they won't want to do anything else.
The date is 10/10/2018
Unfortunately C# for Unity is always being updated.
So scripts that you copy from the internet may not work if 
too much time has passed since they were written.
